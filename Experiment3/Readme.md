## Write a program to accept N integers from the user and store them in an array. Sort the array in ascending order using **Bubble sort**. Then accept another number from the user, search whether that number exists in the array using **Binary Search**. If it does, display its index and if it doesnâ€™t, then print that the number is not found in the array.
